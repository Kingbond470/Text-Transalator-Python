About Application
It automatically detects the language and translate to english by default.
It also doesn't guarantee that the library would work properly at all times, if you want to use a stable API you should use the official Google Translate API.

Using this library a lot, Google translate may block your IP address, consider using proxies by passing a proxy dictionary to proxies parameter in Translator() class, or use the official API as discussed.
